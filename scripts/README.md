# Scripts

Here is all the scripts that help me in my home infrastructure journey.

## Conventions

Use the [`_template`](./_template) script as a starting point for new scripts.

### Naming

- `prep_*`: do some form of pulling in resources and manipulating them
- `sync_*`: move data from somewhere to somewhere else
- `write_*`: move something to an SD card
